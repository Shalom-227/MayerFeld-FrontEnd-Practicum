                    <strong>Gardening</strong> has become more than just a pastime for me—it's a deeply rewarding journey of nurturing life and watching it flourish. 
                    I’ve successfully transplanted suckers of banana and plantain, giving them a fresh start in rich soil. 
                    My soursop seedlings are now bedded and thriving, while tomatoes are already showing signs of vibrant growth. 
                    Currently, I’m working on cultivating watermelons, and the anticipation of seeing those juicy fruits develop is incredibly exciting.
                    This hobby is one of the most relaxing things I enjoy doing. 
                    It teaches patience, perseverance, care, love, desire for growth and brings a sense of accomplishment with every sprout and harvest. 
                    It’s a quiet joy that keeps giving and gets my eyes off the screen.
