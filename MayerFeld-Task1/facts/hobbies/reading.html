                    <strong>I love reading</strong>, though I hesitate to call myself a bookworm. 
                    When I'm not caught up in the daily bustle, I find joy in exploring materials that spark my curiosity—ranging from politics and fiction to entertainment, religion, and materials on tech innovation. 
                    There's a saying that <em>a reader lives a thousand lives</em>; 
                    perhaps I haven’t yet, but I’m certainly on the path.
                    The beauty of <strong> reading</strong> lies in its power to inform, expand one’s horizons, introduce new ways of expressing thoughts, and—perhaps most importantly—keep the mind sharp.
                    Here is a short list of <a href="../books.html"><em>books</em></a> I have read.
