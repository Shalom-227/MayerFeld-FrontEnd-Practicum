                    Every other day, when time permits, I find myself binge-watching recaps of new movie releases or diving into shorts on the iconic red and white app.                     If it’s not comedy, it’s news—and if it’s not news, it’s entertainment. 
                    YouTube has been a remarkably resourceful platform for me, especially since my university days. 
                    It’s become a daily companion, offering both learning and leisure.
                    There’s hardly a day I don’t visit it. Sometimes I wonder—maybe I should be a content creator too. Who knows? Maybe I’d do even better on the other side of the screen.
