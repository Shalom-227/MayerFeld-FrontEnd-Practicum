                    Practicing movement is one of the best things we can do as humans. 
                    I love to exercise when I can, and one workout I particularly enjoy is skipping. 
                    It’s a powerful cardiovascular exercise that offers a range of benefits—from improving heart health and coordination to boosting stamina and burning calories.

                    Unlike running down the street, skipping can be done in a compact space and is gentler on the joints—provided you have good knees. 
                    It’s rhythmic, energizing, and surprisingly fun. 
                    For me, skipping isn’t just about fitness; it’s a way to reconnect with my body, clear my mind, and feel alive.
