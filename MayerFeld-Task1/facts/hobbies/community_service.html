                    I love to serve. 
                    I enjoy offering service to people and seeing them happy, getting better, and developing a more positive outlook on life.
                    It feels more like a calling than a hobby. When I’m not engaged in my other interests, you’ll likely find me at an orphanage home, freely offering my time and care, or attending non-profit meetings where I serve as tech support.

                    I love to see things work—and work properly. Whether it’s helping someone navigate a challenge or ensuring a system runs smoothly, the joy of service lies in the impact it creates. 
                    It’s not just about doing good; it’s about being part of something meaningful, something that uplifts others and brings purpose to my own journey.I’d do even better on the other side of the screen.
