                    Perhaps you’ve heard that saying. 
                    I find joy in trivia games, and on a lighter note, I’d say they’re one of the sparks behind my passion for reading. 
                    Trivia sharpens mental recall and encourages information binging in the most enjoyable way.
                    Whether played in tag-teams or one-on-one, trivia games bring out the fun in learning. 
                    They’re a classic example of an in-house game that welcomes participants of all ages. 
                    On a good day, diving into trivia is one of my favorite ways to unwind and stay mentally engaged.
